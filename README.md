## Built with

* Java 12 (JDK 12.0.2)
* Maven

* CSS3

## To run the project:

* Clone the repository using `git clone` and paste it in your terminal.
* Run `mvn clean package` from the project directory
* Run project using `java -jar target/myportfolio.jar`, then open a browser window and go to `localhost:8080`.
